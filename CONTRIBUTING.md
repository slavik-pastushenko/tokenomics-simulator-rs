```

### Documentation

Generate documentation in HTML format:

```bash

```


## Examples

We encourage contributors to create examples that demonstrate the features of the `tokenomics-simulator` crate. Examples help users understand how to use the crate and provide practical use cases.

### Creating an Example

1. **Create a new example file**: Add a new file in the examples directory with a descriptive name, such as `examples/my_feature_example.rs`.

2. **Write the example code**: Write the code that demonstrates the feature. Ensure that the code is well-documented and includes comments explaining each step.

3. **Test the example**: Run the example to ensure it works as expected using the following command:

    ```sh
    cargo run --example my_feature_example
    ```
4. **Submit a pull request**: Follow the steps in the `Submitting Pull Requests` section to submit your example.

### Running Examples

To run an example, use the following command:

```sh
cargo run --example example_name
```

Replace `example_name` with the name of the example file (without the `.rs` extension).
